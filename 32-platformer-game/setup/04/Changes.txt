Game.js:
- fixed offset in tilemap
- changed drawPlayer's Math.floor to Math.round for smoother display
- collison map in game.world

- collider function to collide with collision map instead of borders of screen.
- added broad phase collsion detection
	broad face collision function gets tile's collison value from collision map 
	and hands that value + the player object to the Routing Function.

- added collider class
	- routing function
		- checks collision value in switch statement
			calls appropriate narrow face collsion methods
	- added narrow phase collision function
	   does collsion decection + response

- added base class for player (Game.World.Object) player enherits from
  Simple rectangle to use for collsion
  - base class has xOld and yOld properties 
  - has a lot of helper functions:
	- getBottom
	- getRight
	- getTop
	- getOldBottom
	- getOldLeft
	- getOldRight
	- getOldTop
	- setBottom
	- setLeft
	- setRight
	- setTop
	- setOldBottom
	- setOldLeft
	- setOldRight
	- setOldTop

  [x] Game.World.Object.Player now extends object class
		// constructor call (x = 100, y = 100, w = 12, h = 12)

  [x] Extend player Prototype off of Object prototype with Object.assign (prototype, basePrototype)
